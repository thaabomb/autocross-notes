The primary objective here is to become a faster autocross driver. I’m hoping these notes will help.

# Notes from 2025-12-20 event
You can slalom more aggresively than you think you can.

# Notes from watching Evolution-Autocrosser on YouTube
You must backside the slalom cones.
Take a wide entry for hairpins.
Mount your GoPro at the top center of the windshield, outside the car.
