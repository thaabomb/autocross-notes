The primary objective here is to become a faster autocross driver. I’m hoping these notes will help.

# Notes from 2025-12-20 event
You can slalom more aggresively than you realize.

Don't DNF because you got lost. You must pay close attention to the course and continue to visualize it in your head even after you think you've nailed it.

Check your times after every run. If you DNF'd, review your video to understand why.

Having redundant video/data recording systems will allow you to capture the run even if one system fails.

The automatic start/stop feature of Harry's Laptimer failed me. I'm 99% confident that I set the start and stop markers correctly but Laptimer terminated the run early for every single run. I should first try using the manual start/stop mode and if that fails I should try a different app.

I was on Hankook Ventus V12 Evo 2 tires. Those are Max Performance Summer tires. I expect the tires were close to the spec pressure but I did not meaure them. Wear patterns suggest that I needed to lower the pressures.

The morning session (runs 1-3) was cold (40s or 50s) but the afternoon session (runs 4-6) was warmer (60s or 70s).

# Notes from watching Evolution-Autocrosser on YouTube
You must backside the slalom cones.

Take a wide entry for hairpins.

Mount your GoPro at the top center of the windshield, outside the car.

When walking the course, count the cones in the slaloms. Determine if they are equidistant, increasing-distance, or decreasing distance. For optional slaloms, determine which entrance direction will allow you to skip the last slalom cone.

Keep it tight, always.

Playback video at half speed or slower to make analysis easier.

Even-cone slalom you enter and exit on opposite sides. odd-cone slalom you enter and exit on the same side.

# Notes from watching Warhorse-Racing on YouTube
The course walk is necessary but not sufficient. The information you gain from your first run will be even more important because it is data that was gathered at speed.

Look ahead at the next element or two or three. This can set you up for the next element and prevent DNFs.

Draw a map of the course. Print out a Google Maps capture of the area and bring it with you.

Chalk your tires to determine the correct pressure.

Be early with your inputs. Don't be late.

Break sweepers down into entry, middle, and exit.
 
Every autocross course is different but they're typically made up of the same elements:
slaloms, Chicago boxes, lane changes, sweepers, hairpins, offset cones, chutes, gates, eyebrows.

When you're in line waiting for your turn, you can be looking ahead to the first two or three elements of the course.

# Notes from watching SCCA videos on YouTube
Your job as a novice autocross driver is to not get lost on course.

# Notes from watching GTheory-Coaching on YouTube
Position over speed.

# Notes from reading Autocross to Win
If you make more power than you can put down, the excess power is wasted. AWD is the most effective way to put power down. An AWD car with big power potential would make a fantastic autocross car. Bonus points if it's lightweight and has double wishbone suspension. This makes the Mitsubishi Eclipse / Eagle Talon TSi basically the perfect autocross car. Other exciting choices include: EVO, AWD CTR, NC1 NSX, Audis maybe?, Golf R, Huracán, 911 Turbo, Carrera4?, GTR, Tesla 3 Performance

# Thoughts
There are two driving paradigms that one might adopt: use the grippiest tires available to achieve the fastest time; or, use the least grippy tires available to lower the speed of the traction limit to help you learn. When employing the learning paradigm, don't compare your times to other people's times. Only compare them to your own times.

Do I need to switch to wider front tires to mitigate understeer?

BMWCCA, PCA, and NASA host autocross events too. Consider joining their events to get more runs in. Check MotorsportReg.com and ClubRegistration.net.

Fast out is more important than fast in.

The Apex Pro app wouldn't let me import data that was recorded by a different app.
