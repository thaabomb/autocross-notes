The primary objective here is to become a faster autocross driver. I’m hoping these notes will help.

# Notes from 2025-12-20 event
You can slalom more aggresively than you realize.

Don't DNF because you got lost. You must pay close attention to the course and continue to visualize it in your head even after you think you've nailed it.

Check your times after every run. If you DNF'd, review your video to understand why.

Having redundant video/data recording systems will allow you to capture the run even if one system fails.

# Notes from watching Evolution-Autocrosser on YouTube
You must backside the slalom cones.

Take a wide entry for hairpins.

Mount your GoPro at the top center of the windshield, outside the car.

When walking the course, count the cones in the slaloms. Determine if they are equidistant, increasing-distance, or decreasing distance. For optional slaloms, determine which entrance direction will allow you to skip the last slalom cone.

Keep it tight, always.

Playback video at half speed or slower to make analysis easier.

Even-cone slalom you enter and exit on opposite sides. odd-cone slalom you enter and exit on the same side.

# Notes from watching Warhorse-Racing on YouTube

The course walk is necessary but not sufficient. The information you gain from your first run will be even more important because it is data that was gathered at speed.

Look ahead at the next element or two or three. This can set you up for the next element and prevent DNFs.

Draw a map of the course. Print out a Google Maps capture of the area and bring it with you.

Chalk your tires to determine the correct pressure.

Every autocross course is different but they're typically made up of the same elements:
slaloms, Chicago boxes, lane changes, sweepers, hairpins, offset cones, chutes, gates.

# Thoughts

There are two driving paradigms that one might adopt: use the grippiest tires available to achieve the fastest time; or, use the least grippy tires available to lower the speed of the traction limit to help you learn. When employing the learning paradigm, don't compare your times to other people's times. Only compare them to your own times.

Do I need to switch to wider front tires to mitigate understeer?
